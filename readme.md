#Developer Connector
Social networking site built with the MERN stack. Users can sign up, create a profile, add experience and/or education, create posts, and comment on posts. Profile will display all info the user provides such as social netwroking sites, personal website, location, work/education history, and their 5 latest github repos(if github username is provided). Can update profile by deleting/adding features and can remove posts if user is the author.

## Future additions

In the future I plan on adding a search feature for users and pagination for posts and users.
